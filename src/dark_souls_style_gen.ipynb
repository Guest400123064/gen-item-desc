Crossbows are designed to be used with a bow, often strings or wires attached to the end of the bowstring. The crossbow\\'s primary form of use is as a weapon, but crossbows can also be used for entertainment or sport. The word \"crossbow\" comes from the Old Norse cr√≥inne, from which the word \"crossbow\" itself derives. The crossbow evolved from the bow, and is one of the oldest types of weapon. Crossbows were used in the Middle Ages to hunt and shoot game such as deer, wild boar, and hare. The crossbow evolved rapidly during the Middle Ages, and by the end of the 15th century, it had been replaced by gunpowder weapons. The earliest crossbows were made from bowstrings of reed or twigs, but a variety of materials was used in the 14th century, including ivory, bone, silver, and gold.',\n",
