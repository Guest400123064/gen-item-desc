Clearing is also the process of marking the boundaries around which vehicles can travel, such as with a solid surface. Clearing also enables vehicles to be driven off the road by reducing the speed of vehicles on the road. Clearing is a process that is carried out by road authorities in order to prevent accidents, to facilitate the movement of vehicles, and to protect the public. Clearing operations prevent continuing damage to public roads, reduce traffic congestion and facilitate the movement of vehicles. Clearing operations also prevent the deterioration of road surfaces, such as over time, that may damage public roads. Clearing operations also prevent the introduction of new roads into the network and the weakening of existing roads. Clearing operations also prevent the loss of or damage to road infrastructure, such as bridges and tunnels.

They may be found in the wild on any solid surface, such as a sandbar, beach, or mountain glacier. They may also be found in the wild in populations ranging in size from a few hundred to a few thousand individuals. Cougars are typically large, fierce, and unpredictable animals that are usually found in large numbers and in large natural settings. They are members of the genus Leopardus, which includes black, cougar, and lion species. They are often found in packs, and when this occurs, the large numbers of cougars lead to their dominance over the other animals in their area of habitat. They are also a part of the large Felis caribou population that live on the tundra in the Canadian Rockies.
