It may be a container of spirits, wine, or spirits mixed with other ingredients such as fruit juice, fruit pulp, or food.\n\nThe word bottle has been used in several ways, including as a storage container, as a form of communication, and as a metaphor for the human body. The earliest known bottle was a reed basket that was used as a storage container. It was not until around the year 1000 that a true bottle was created. Contructed from two saucers, the neck of the bottle was filled with water and then filled with a varnish or lacquer that inhibited the growth of any kind of fungus. The lid of the bottle was attached to the top of the saucer and the neck of the bottle was then filled with water. The bottle was then placed in a cool, dark place and aged for a period of time before drinking. The original bottle was made of smooth, china glass and was used for storing wine. The earliest known surviving bottle is from the 13th century and is from the Monastery of the Most Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.

{"prompt": "[ITEM]: wooden walls\n[CATEGORY]: Inside Church\n[BASE_DESC]: The shape of a wall is determined by the material used for its construction. Some materials, such as stone, are more resistant to weathering and erosion than other materials, such as wood or glass. Other materials, such as wood or glass, have a more flexible structure that can be easily damaged by water, or can be easily damaged by other materials, such as abrasion. The shape of a wall can also be affected by its size, shape, and number of windows, doors, and other openings. Some walls consist of a solid layer of material, while other walls consist of a solid core of material joined to a wall of other material. The shape of walls has varied greatly over time and across cultures.[citation needed]\n\nThe study of walls is an academic discipline that focuses on the physical and biological studies of solid surfaces, and their function in human societies.[citation needed] In many studies, such as the design and construction of walls, the study of walls has been linked to the study of biology and human evolution.[1] In some cases, such as the study of human emotion and cognition, the study of walls has been linked to the study of human psychology, sociology, or anthropology.[2] In more recent times, the study of\n[DESC]: ", "completion": "the wall is plastered white\n\n===\n"}

Crosses are also used as a form of currency, as part of the fashion trade, and as decoration. They are also used as a form of social communicating, with the two branches of the trade being known as 'cross-dressing' or 'cross-trading'. Cross-dressing is the act of dressing or undressing someone other than their true or natural sex. Cross-trading is the act of trading cross-dresses for clothes, jewellery, or other 'real' goods. Cross-shopping is the process of browsing websites or shopping centres to find cross-dresses that fit the wearer's requirements. Cross-selling is the process of selling goods or services on the basis of a person's sex. Cross-dressing was used for centuries as a way of communicating sexual attraction and was used in the 19th and 20th centuries for a variety of reasons, including fashion, philosophy, culture, social interoperability, and 'transcendentalism'.

A rivet usually has a small hole or slit in its edge for access to the hardware. Rivets can be rounded or pointed, but most of the time they are smooth and have a small hole or slit in the outer edge.

The archway is an open-air, horizontal passage with a light, airy, and strong design purpose. All archways need to be able to be air-breathed on, and are therefore constructed of solid materials such as stone, concrete, or wood. The archway is also constructed to resist wear and tear. This allows the archway to be used by people who wear clothes, and therefore requires less material to support. The archway is also constructed to be strong enough to survive a large number of use-by dates and temperature changes, such as being used in the most intense conditions such as indoors, outdoors, and in the harsh environment of a studio, rehearsal hall, or the like. The archway is also constructed to be water- and dust-resistant, and to be able to resist impact from falling objects and water. A basic archway is a passage with a horizontal, solid surface (such as a wall or floor) that is used for the transfer of force from the floor to the wall or wall-to-floor movement of a person.

Cannon evolved from the medieval flintlock weapon, with the use of polished stones or other body parts for trigger, aim, and firepulse. The word cannon was first recorded in 1707, by the Dutch scientist and cartographer Martin van Oldenbarneich. The Dutch words gunpowder and cannon are derived from the Old Norse krungnagr, which means 'thickened horn' or 'thick stone'. The name may also be derived from the Old Norse cr\u00f3nnjrndr, 'a horn mounted on a cart or horse',[1] which would make the horn a cannon.

{"prompt": "[ITEM]: decay\n[CATEGORY]: underwater aquapolis\n[BASE_DESC]: How does a decomposition of iron iron oxide work? Well, iron iron oxide, which is the iron in iron, absorbs and releases heat. The process of decomposing iron iron oxide, which is the iron in iron oxide, releases heat. The heat is then used to create new iron in the iron oxide. This process is called \"enrichment.\" Iron in the iron oxide is then used to make more iron. This process is called \"deprotonation.\" The last step in the ironing process is adding more iron oxide to the iron in the iron oxide. This process is called \"deprotonation of iron oxide.\" The end result is the iron in the iron oxide being oxidized, or converted to iron in the iron oxide, or iron in the iron oxide being reduced.\n\nWhy would I want to do this? A metal will oxidize or reduce itself to give it a shiny finish. An oxidation or reduction in the metal will therefore effect the shiny finish of the metal. The metal will therefore wear down or weaken over time. As a result, the metal will need to be replaced. This is different from other materials, such as glass, which will not need to be replaced.\n\nWhat can I do with iron?

The term originally referred to a structure consisting of a tent, many layers of fabric and other materials attached together to form a structure. The term is now broadly used to refer to a wide range of multi-layered, multi-functional structures, with tents having been used for many purposes throughout history. Tentmaking has historically been a highly competitive industry, with the trend in recent years towards the development of modular, self-contained tent systems. The term 'tent' was first used in 1779 by French explorer Jacques Cartier, to refer to a large, multi-layered, and luxurious tent. The term 'tent pole' was used by British explorer Sir George Roope in 1785 to refer to a pole with a tent-like shape. In the mid 19th century, semi-tent and hottentot cultures of Africa, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands used cloth-covered tents. These cultures later adopted the flat, or flat-top, tent and, in the mid-20th century, the modular tent.

In most countries, seeds are generally dried and frozen in the field. This is done to protect the plant from bad weather and to preserve the seed for future harvest. Drying and freezing also prevents the growth of new seeds. A good food for most plants is an annual seed crop that is ripe by the time the next harvest is due. This ensures that the next harvest will be as good as or better than the last. In some cases, such as on farms with limited land available, a crop of seedlings may be more useful.
